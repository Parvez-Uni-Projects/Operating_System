## Problem Statement

Write a program for Deadlock detection using resource allocation graph for a single quantity of each resources using a cycle detection algorithm using RAG

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Accept the resource allocation graph as input.
3. Perform dfs on the resource allocation graph.
4. If a cycle is detected, then deadlock is detected.
5. Stop



## Output

```
Total Cycle      : 2
Deadlock detected!
```
